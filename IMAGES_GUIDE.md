## How to Add Images to the Website

1. **Download the Image**:
   - Find an appropriate image from one of the resources above
   - Download the largest available size
   - Make sure the image has proper licensing for commercial use

2. **Optimize the Image** (recommended for performance):
   - Use a tool like [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) to compress without losing quality
   - Aim for a file size under 500KB for the hero image and under 200KB for the office image

3. **Rename and Save the File**:
   - Rename to either `hero.jpg` or `office.jpg`
   - Save in the `images` directory of your project

4. **Replace Placeholder SVGs**:
   - The website is currently set up with SVG placeholders
   - Simply adding the proper JPG files will automatically replace the placeholders

## Image Guidelines

1. **Professional Appearance**:
   - Choose images that reflect professionalism and corporate values
   - Avoid overly casual or inappropriate imagery

2. **Cultural Relevance**:
   - Since this is a Japanese corporation, Japanese-style business environments or Osaka views are appropriate
   - Consider the cultural context and business formality of Japan

3. **Technical Requirements**:
   - Use JPG format for photos (PNG is acceptable if transparency is needed)
   - The hero image should be landscape orientation for proper display
   - Images should be sharp and well-lit

4. **Legal Considerations**:
   - Ensure you have proper rights to use all images
   - Respect copyright and licensing terms
   - When using free stock photos, check if attribution is required

## Temporary Placeholder Images

Currently, the website uses SVG placeholder images:
- `images/hero.svg` - A placeholder for the hero background
- `images/office.svg` - A placeholder for the office image

These are designed to work temporarily until you add the actual photographic images. Once you add the JPG images with the correct filenames, the website will automatically use them instead of the placeholders.
